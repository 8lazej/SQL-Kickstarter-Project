# SQL-Kickstarter-Project
This is a SQL project based on Kickstarter data

For this project, I'll take on the role of a data analyst at a startup. The product team is considering launching a campaign on Kickstarter to test the viability of some offerings. I've been asked to pull data that will help the team understand what might influence the success of a campaign. 

## Questions:


### What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
### Which projects fail?

## Data

 - `ID:` Kickstarter project ID
 - `name:` Name of project
 - `category:` Category of project
 - `main_category:` Main category of project
 - `goal:` Fundraising goal
 - `pledged:` Amount pledged
 - `state`: State of project (successful, canceled, etc.)
 - `backers:` Number of project backers
